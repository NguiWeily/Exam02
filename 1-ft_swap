Write a function that swaps the contents of two integers the adresses of which
are passed as parameters.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	ft_swap(int *a, int *b);

Certainly! Here's an implementation of the `ft_swap` function in C:

```c
void ft_swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```

In this implementation, the `ft_swap` function takes two integer pointers as input (`int *a` and `int *b`) and swaps the values they point to.

The function uses a temporary variable `temp` to store the value of `*a`. It then assigns the value of `*b` to `*a`, and finally assigns the value of `temp` to `*b`. This way, the values of the two integers are swapped.

Since the function modifies the values at the addresses pointed to by `a` and `b`, there is no need to return anything. The changes made inside the function will be reflected outside the function.
